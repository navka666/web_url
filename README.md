This application was developed for url management. It allows you to create, edit and delete short urls. The user may enter a valid url and application will create a shorter url for him, that will redirect to the original page. Also the user can set a short url by himself. But after 14 days after a creation, the record will be deleted from the database. The 'Click' field shows how many times a short url was used or clicked.
I'll be glad to see your comments and suggestions.
